2. Click **"Get started"**

4. Select region: **us-central** (same as Firestore)
5. Click **"Done"**

### 3. Enable Authentication

## âœ… Verification Steps

Once you've completed the above:
- Firestore Database shows "Cloud Firestore" tab
- Storage shows empty bucket
- Authentication shows "Anonymous" as enabled
- Functions shows getting started page
- Project is on Blaze plan

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes
- All services should use **us-central** region for consistency
- Test mode rules are temporary - we'll deploy proper security rules
- Blaze plan has generous free tier - charges only for usage beyond limits

Let me know when these steps are complete! âœ…
