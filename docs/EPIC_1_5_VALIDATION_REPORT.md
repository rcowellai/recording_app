- `epic15_expired_session` (expired)  
- `epic15_completed_session` (completed)
- `epic15_removed_session` (removed)

### **2. Run End-to-End Validation Tests** ⚠️ **REQUIRED**

**Commands to Execute**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure recording app is running
cd recording-app && npm run dev

# 2. Run Playwright tests  
npx playwright test

# 3. Manual URL testing
# Visit each URL in EPIC_1_5_TEST_URLS.md and verify expected behavior
```

### **3. Validate Epic 1.5 Success Criteria** ⚠️ **REQUIRED**

| Criteria | Target | Test Method |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Recording Success Rate | ≥90% | Multiple recording attempts |
| Upload Success Rate | ≥95% | Multiple file uploads |
| Cross-Browser Compatibility | 100% | Chrome/Firefox/Edge testing |
