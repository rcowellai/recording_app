# Love Retold Integration Boundaries

## üéØ Quick Reference: What to Build vs. What Exists

### üöÄ RECORDING APP RESPONSIBILITIES (Wave 3)
**Frontend-Only Integration**

```yaml
‚úÖ BUILD THESE:
  - SESSION_ID parsing from URL parameters
  - Recording interface with MP4 codec (already built)  
  - Chunked upload to Love Retold storage paths
  - Status updates to Love Retold recordingSessions collection
  - Love Retold branding and UI integration
  - Cross-browser compatibility (Safari testing)

‚ùå DO NOT BUILD:
  - Cloud Functions (use Love Retold's existing)
  - Transcription pipeline (Love Retold has Whisper)
  - Story creation workflow (Love Retold handles)
  - Email/SMS systems (Love Retold platform manages)
  - User authentication (anonymous recording only)
```

### üè¢ LOVE RETOLD PLATFORM PROVIDES
**Existing Infrastructure - Do Not Duplicate**

```yaml
‚úÖ ALREADY EXISTS:
  - Firebase project (love-retold-production)
  - Cloud Functions: validateSession, processRecording, etc.
  - OpenAI Whisper transcription processing
  - Story creation and management system
  - Real-time updates via Zustand stores
  - Email/SMS prompt delivery system
  - User authentication and management
```

## üîó Integration Pattern

```
Recording App ‚Üí Love Retold Firebase ‚Üí Love Retold Functions ‚Üí Love Retold Processing
```

**NOT:**
```
Recording App ‚Üí Own Firebase ‚Üí Own Functions ‚Üí Own Processing
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't Build Backend**: Use Love Retold's existing Cloud Functions
2. **Don't Process Transcriptions**: Love Retold's Whisper pipeline handles this
3. **Don't Create Stories**: Love Retold platform manages story creation
4. **Don't Handle Emails**: Love Retold sends prompt notifications
