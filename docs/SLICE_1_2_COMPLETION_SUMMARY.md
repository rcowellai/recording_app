- **Styling**: Modern CSS with flexbox/grid
- **Build Tools**: Vite with optimized production builds

### **Browser APIs Used**
- MediaRecorder API for audio recording
- getUserMedia API for device access
- Web Storage API for session management
- Fetch API for Firebase communication

---

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### **Session Security**
- URL-based session access with validation
- Anonymous authentication for file uploads
- Session expiration handling (7-day limit)
- Secure filename generation with timestamps

### **Data Protection**
- Client-side validation before upload
- Secure Firebase Storage rules integration
- Error message sanitization
- No sensitive data exposure in client code

## 📱 User Experience Features

### **Recording Flow**
1. **Session Validation**: Instant feedback on link validity
2. **Permission Request**: Clear microphone access prompts
3. **Recording Interface**: Visual feedback during recording
4. **Preview & Confirm**: Audio playback before saving
5. **Upload Progress**: Real-time upload status
6. **Completion Confirmation**: Success message with next steps

### **Error Handling**
- Browser compatibility detection
- Microphone access troubleshooting
- Network connectivity issues
- Session state error messages
- Upload failure recovery

### **Responsive Design**
