## ðŸŽ¯ What We're Testing

**The Complete User Journey**:
1. User clicks recording link â†’ Recording page opens
2. User records audio â†’ Audio is captured successfully  
3. User saves recording â†’ File uploads to Firebase
4. System processes recording â†’ Story is created automatically
5. User can view story â†’ Story appears with playback

**Why This Matters**: We've built all the pieces, now we verify they work together as one system.
